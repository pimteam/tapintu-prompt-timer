# tapintu-prompt-timer
Random journal prompts with timer

WP Plugin provides a shortcode [tapintu-prompt-timer] which then places a random prompt triggered by a button, and a timer with sound.

In this version, Journal prompts are all hard-coded.

### RoadMap
- create an admin interface to allow for adding/deleting/editing and sorting all prompts
- admin interface to allow for setting different sound files for the timer
- admin interface to allow for setting different timing options for the timer
- integrate WPForms form addition
