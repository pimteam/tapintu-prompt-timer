# tapintu-prompt-timer
Random journal prompts with timer

WP Plugin provides a shortcode [tapintu-prompt-timer] which then places a random prompt triggered by a button, and a timer with sound.

In this version, Journal prompts are all hard-coded.

### Known Issues
- the prompt and timer display show up in the WP pages editing interface in the "Publish" details area, as well as in the page listing in the SEO and Readability columns
- the prompt and timer are placed at the top of the page (right under article title) no matter where on the page the shortcode is placed


### RoadMap
- create an admin interface to allow for adding/deleting/editing and sorting all prompts
- admin interface to allow for setting different sound files for the timer
- admin interface to allow for setting different timing options for the timer
- integrate WPForms form addition
